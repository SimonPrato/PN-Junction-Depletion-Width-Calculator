# PN-Junction-Depletion-Width-Calculator
This project calculates the depletion width of a semiconductor pn-junction, depending on the applied reverse-biased voltage. It is accessible under this [GitHub Page](https://simonprato.github.io/pn-depletion-width/). In this repository, the HTML, JS and image files can be found.
